i'm originally from malaysia and graduated in spring 2025 from uc berkeley with a b.s. in electrical engineering and computer science. this fall, i'll be starting my master's in computer science at uc irvine, where i'm planning to graduate in december 2026. right now, i'm working at [zoofi](https://www.zoofi.ai/) as a software engineer, helping build out our mvp from the ground up. before that, i was involved in research at berkeley's haas school of business, where i developed machine learning tools to uncover insights and support data-driven findings.

i'm open to internship opportunities for summer 2026 in software engineering, machine learning, and robotics.
