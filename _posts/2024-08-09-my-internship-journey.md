today, i presented the work i've been doing during my internship over the past three months, and it was a rewarding experience. i admit, i was a bit nervous at first, but once i started showcasing my work, everything felt natural – i couldn’t help but feel proud.

there’s something incredibly powerful about building a product from the ground up and fully owning the process. of course, none of this would have been possible without the guidance and support of my mentor and colleagues.

while i’ve worked on front-end and back-end development separately in the past, this was my first experience handling both simultaneously. this challenge pushed me to think more holistically about system design, enabling me to create a more sophisticated product – and setting the stage for even better work in the future.

some of the key tasks i accomplished during this project include:
- leveraged data science libraries (sklearn, seaborn, pandas, keras) and experimented with classification models (svm, lr, xgboost, dl).
- created a data pipeline for preprocessing, training, and classification, and ensured data balance with techniques like smote.
- designed and tested a rest api using flask, integrated fasttext for multilabel classification, and began work on sharepoint api integration.
- developed front-end components with react, deployed the website to the production server, and merged different application versions.
- writing documentation for application files and experiments.
- a lot of debugging.

overall, great experience. would definitely try again.
