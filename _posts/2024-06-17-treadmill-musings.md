before each run, while i’m doing my non-negotiable stretch, i often ask myself what i want to think about. the hardest part of running for me is being alone with my thoughts. as the treadmill starts moving, i slowly ramp up the pace until i reach a state of equilibrium where i can maintain my speed but still challenge myself. then i start zoning out. it’s like going to the spa, but for my mind—a time to think about my long- and short-term goals and reflect on my day.

near the end, my thoughts start to fade away, and my focus shifts to the numbers in front of me: distance, time, and calories burned. i then decide whether i want to stop running at a certain distance or time—i usually pick whichever makes me run longer.

in david goggins’ book, *can’t hurt me*, he shares the sixty percent rule, which states that when we’re about to give up, we’ve only given sixty percent of ourselves. though not backed by science, i keep this belief in mind, and more often than not, i surprise myself with things i thought i couldn’t do.

like many sports, running not only challenges our physical abilities but also requires a great deal of perseverance and grit. the main reason i started running wasn’t just to improve physically but also because of the mental challenge.

i often think to myself, *if i can’t even do well on the treadmill, what makes me think i can do well in school?* that thought has single-handedly helped me reach closer to one hundred percent every time.
