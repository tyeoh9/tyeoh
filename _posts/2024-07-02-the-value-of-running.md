though running is not exactly my thing, i believe that everyone should at least do some form of cardio regularly. i hate to admit it but the hardest part of running for me is the lack of distractions. it’s just my music, my thoughts, and the sound of me breathing. there really isn’t much that i can do on the treadmill other than move my legs and think about stuff. however, i have discovered that it not only leads to a healthier life but also offers incredible value. here are the main lessons i’ve learned from running.

### numbing discomfort with productive thinking

utilizing this time to reflect on my daily activities is quite nice. it gives me a chance to reconsider what i have done and plan for what i want to accomplish. moreover, i've found that using this time to outline my long-term goals is highly efficient. it's essentially a dedicated period to focus solely on important decisions. recently, i've been using this time to think about my graduate school plans and my internship work.

### discipline

unlike lifting weights, running is long and grueling. in david goggins’ book, *can’t hurt me*, he shares the sixty percent rule, which states that when we’re about to give up, we’ve only given sixty percent of ourselves. in other words, we need to trick our brains so that we can do more. i often think to myself, *if i can’t even do well on the treadmill, what makes me think i can do well in school?* that thought has helped me reach closer to one hundred percent every single time.

### providing structure to my day

this last point doesn’t just apply to running, but pretty much everything (remotely productive) that we do. whether it is going to the gym, walking the dog, or throwing out the trash, the little things that we do daily are essential for building a solid foundation for the rest of the day. it is that little nudge that we need to get the ball rolling. before regularly exercising, i found myself not doing anything of value on days when i had no work to do and feeling like garbage at the end of the day.

### conclusion

whether you are trying to find more time for focused thinking or aiming to instill more structure into your life, making running a non-negotiable part of your schedule will help you achieve these goals. running alone won’t single-handedly improve your life, but it will help you develop the perseverance and grit needed to excel in other areas.
