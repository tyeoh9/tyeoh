i recently completed my first year at berkeley and can honestly say that i learned the most as a 
person during my time here. hands down. compared to community college, life is totally different here. i’m not saying that my community college experience was bad, in fact, it was great, but in a sense, it felt a little too much like home. i needed to get out of my cushioned seat to truly embrace growth.

the rigor of the uc berkeley kicked my butt. at times, i wondered whether i bit off more than i could chew or even whether i was fit for this, but it was the struggle that made the results that much more rewarding. although i wasn’t passing my classes with flying colors like i had previously done, i felt like i understood the concepts that were being taught more while also enjoying the learning process.

when i arrived back in malaysia a couple weeks ago, i decided to take time off by eating and wandering around, but it didn’t feel right. i was so accustomed to the hustle that doing nothing for the entire day felt like a crime–it made me feel terrible. last week, i started running *almost* every day and i plan to do so before the school year starts. doing so has provided structure to my day, but most importantly, it has given me something to challenge myself partly because i am not a great runner and i hate it.

one of the reasons why i wanted to make this post was because i wanted to reflect a little on the past year and how i have changed as a person. moreover, i wanted to make it a habit of mine to write more frequently, because i truly believe that being able to write (and communicate) effectively is one of the most important life skills. as you (the 0 viewers reading this) can tell by this post, i am not the best writer.

like the goat once said, “your idea is only as good as how you communicate it."
